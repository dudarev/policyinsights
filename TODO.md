## Make sure content which is loaded with | safe filter is indeed safe. Search TODO in code.

## Rename tags to parameters or keys?

In OpenStreetMap tag is a combination of key=value.
Key is more understandable for developers.
Parameter is may be more clear for general public.
If we use parameter, we could not use short form /p/ since it's taken by program.

## Make comparison look good on mobile

## Put sparkline bars next to compared properties

## Reddit AMA feature

Reddit has a subreddit for AMA (ask me anything) where users may vote on question to some well-known people.

For example, Bill Gates AMA:

## Reddit news and links submission

In the spirit of Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit)
we may implement links submission for every program.

This way users who follow relevant for them programs would have feeds of links related to those programs.
