## Rename tags to parameters or keys?

In OpenStreetMap tag is a combination of key=value.
Key is more understandable for developers.
Parameter is may be more clear for general public.
If we use parameter, we could not use short form /p/ since it's taken by program.

## Make comparison look good on mobile
